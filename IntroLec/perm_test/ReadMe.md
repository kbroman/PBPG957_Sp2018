Illustration of permutation test for QTL mapping
----------------------------------------------------------------------

See it in action [here](http://www.biostat.wisc.edu/~kbroman/D3/lod_random).

This is an illustration of a permutation test: To assess whether a
given LOD score is sufficiently large to indicate evidence of a QTL,
we compare it to the distribution of the genome-wide maximum LOD score
under the null hypothesis of no QTL.

The null distribution of the genome-wide maximum LOD is estimated by
permuting the phenotypes relative to the genotypes.

Click the green button to shuffle the phenotypes and re-draw the LOD
curves.

There&rsquo;s a hidden &ldquo;back&rdquo; button a bit to the right of
the green button.
